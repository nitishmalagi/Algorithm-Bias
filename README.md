# Algorithm-Bias
The objective of this task is to assess the impact of algorithm bias on machine learning algorithms trained with imbalanced data.

In the first stage the Breast Cancer dataset has been loaded and the bias of classifiers is assessed i.e. whether the classifiers are biased towards the majority class. The classifiers used are k-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes from sklearn. The bias has been tested using hold-out testing and cross-validation.

Next, a strategy has been proposed to rectify this bias. The effectiveness of this strategy has been evaluated in terms of classification bias and overall accuracy.

Further, the impact of the chosen strategty has been tested on 'Wine' dataset.
